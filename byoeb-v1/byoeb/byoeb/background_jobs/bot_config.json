            "user_prompt": "<task_description>\nYou are an assistant to a chatbot (called OncoBot) that helps answer queries of cancer patients and their attendants. Your task is to process any generalizable query-response pairs by removing any Personally Identifiable Information (PII), to ensure patient privacy.\n</task_description>  \n<steps>\n1. Determine whether the provided query and/or response include any generalizable information, i.e., any information that is potentially relevant for other patients and/or attendants.  Refer to important_note generalizable and the examples below. Respond with 'yes' or 'no' for 'generalizable'. \n<important_note_generalizable>\nAll specific information about dates, times, names of doctors/staff, insurance/treatment approvals, or patient/attendant locations will be removed as they are NOT applicable to all patients. After removing such details, does the query and/or response still contain information that is **USEFUL and RELEVANT and APPLICABLE** to other patients or attendants? If yes, set generalizable = yes. If not, set generalizable = no.\n</important_note_generalizable>\n<eg_generalizable_yes>\n<eg1><query>What time need to come on 6th feb for chemotherapy with dr Sharma?</query><response>The specific time for your chemotherapy appointment with Dr. Sharma would be communicated to you by the oncology department. If you haven't received a call, please contact them to confirm your timing.</response></eg1>\n<eg2><query>If my mother gets treatment here at Mumbai and then goes to her native place Kerala and if some problem occurs what shall she do ?</query><response> If your mother experiences any issues after her cancer treatment, it's important to seek medical attention immediately. She can contact the oncology helpline or visit a local oncologist in Kerala for immediate care.</response></eg2> \n</eg_generalizable_yes>\n<eg_generalizable_no>\n<eg1><query>When is Aman's chemotherapy?</query><response>Aman's chemotherapy is on 15th March 2024.</response></eg1>\n<eg2><query>lajwati chaudhury?</query><response>I'm sorry, but your query is unclear. Could you please provide more context or rephrase it? </response></eg2>\n</eg_generalizable_no>\n2. If generalizable = no, leave pii, query_anonymized, and response_anonymized blank in your output. Proceed directly to step 6.\n3. If generalizable = yes, determine whether the provided query and/or response include any PII, i.e., information that can be used to identify the patient and/or attendant, either directly or indirectly. Respond with 'yes' or 'no' for 'pii'. Note: contact information of the hospital is **NOT** considered PII.\n<eg_pii_yes>\n<eg1><query>Any updates on the patient Bhuvan Jain, today morning the chemotherapy was scheduled and we need to travel back to the hometown Mysore?</query><response>His treatment is complete. Discharge typically takes 4 hours. You can travel back to Mysore after discharge. Please contact the oncology desk for more information.</response></eg1>\n<eg2><query_2>I got my cancer diagnosis on 14th dec 2024 can i do exercises like walking etc?</query_2><response_2> Yes, you can perform light exercises such as walking that do not strain your body excessively, after consulting with your oncologist about your specific cancer treatment plan.</response_2>\n</eg2>\n</eg_pii_yes>\n<eg_pii_no>\n<eg1><query>How much medication should I take ?</query><response>The patient should take the prescribed medication as directed by the oncologist. However, it's important to follow the specific instructions provided by your doctor.</response></eg1>\n<eg2><query_2>How do I contact an oncologist?</query_2><response_2> You can contact an oncologist at the cancer center through their helpline or visit the oncology department directly for assistance.</response_2><eg2>\n</eg_pii_no>\n4. If pii = yes, generate query_anonymized and response_anonymized by editing the query and/or response appropriately and **MINIMALLY** to remove all PII and **GENERALIZE** the query and response so it would be applicable, appropriate and useful for other patients. While editing the query and/or response, follow the editing_instructions below:\n<editing_instructions>\n1. **DO NOT ADD ANY NEW INFORMATION**.\n2. **DO NOT REMOVE HOSPITAL CONTACT INFORMATION** like phone number or email IDs. \n3. **REMOVE OR GENERALIZE ANY ABSOLUTE SPECIFICS** about dates, timings, names of doctors or hospital staff, insurance/treatment approvals, and patient/attendants' locations as they are **NOT** applicable to all patients.\n</editing_instructions>\n5. If pii = no, leave query_anonymized and response_anonymized blank in your output.\n6. Output pii, query_anonymized, and response_anonymized in XML format. Do **NOT** generate any other opening or closing explanations or code. Sample output:  \n<output>  \n<generalizable>{yes OR no}</generalizable>\n<pii>{yes OR no OR blank}</pii>\n<query_anonymized>{Edited query OR blank}</query_anonymized>\n<response_anonymized>{Edited response OR blank}</response_anonymized>\n</output>  \n</steps> "
